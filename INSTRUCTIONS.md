# üìù Instructions for Your Snapchat Images

## To Use Your Specific Snapchat Images:

### Option 1: Use the Web Interface (Recommended)
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Right-click on the first image (Seattle Center filter) and save it to your computer
3. Right-click on the second image (Space Needle photo) and save it to your computer
4. Use the upload buttons in the web interface:
   - Upload the Space Needle photo as the "Base Image"
   - Upload the Seattle Center filter as the "Filter/Overlay"

### Option 2: Set Up Demo Images
1. Save the Seattle Center filter image as: `assets/seattle-filter.png`
2. Save the Space Needle photo as: `assets/space-needle.jpg`
3. Open `index.html` - the images will load automatically

## Image Details from Your Snapchat Export:

**Filter Image** (Seattle Center text overlay):
- Black background with white text
- "SEATTLE CENTER" and "Seattle, WA" 
- This should be saved as the filter/overlay

**Base Image** (Space Needle photo):
- Photo of Seattle Space Needle with parking area
- Clear blue sky background
- This should be saved as the base image

## Result:
The web tool will overlay the "SEATTLE CENTER" text on top of the Space Needle photo, recreating your original Snapchat image with the filter applied.
